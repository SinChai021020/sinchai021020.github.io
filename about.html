                        YPC Foodie Guide is a student-led digital initiative specifically designed for the <span style="color:var(--primary); font-weight:800;">YPC International College</span> community. Our journey began with a common daily struggle: wandering through Pudu after lectures, unsure where to find a meal that was both affordable and high in quality.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        Our platform is built on three core pillars: <strong>Reliability, Proximity, and Community</strong>. Every recommendation featured here has been personally visited and tasted by our team members. We verify current prices and check for student-essential features like free WiFi and generous portions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        We remain dedicated to sharing "insider" knowledge that only seasoned Pudu students know—like which stalls give extra gravy for free, or which cafes won't mind if you stay for hours during finals week. Together，we make student life better，one meal at a time.
